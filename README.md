# Setup
1. Create a new github codespace from this repository<br>
2. Ensure you have selected the 4 core machine<br>
3. Execute ```chmod +x setup.sh``` and ```chmod +x start.sh``` in the codespace terminal<br>
4. Execute ```./setup.sh``` in the codespace terminal to set up the VM (This may take up to 5 minutes)<br>
5. You may need to enter `y` to accept package installations. When finished, your all set to start your VM<br>

# Starting the VM
Every time you restart your codespace, you will need to do this. If you close the vnc session, start from step 4.<br>
1. Ensure you have completed the setup. If something doesn't work in this process, thats probably the reason<br>
2. Execute ```./start.sh``` in your codespace terminal. If this command alone throws a error, redo step 3 of the setup<br>
3. Assuming there are no errors, navigate to your ports tab<br>
4. Click on the globe icon next to the port ```6080```<br>
5. Click on the link to ```vnc.html```<br>
6. Click Connect<br>
7. You should load up to a black screen, right click on it<br>
8. This is your toolbar, You can open applications and access the terminal from here<br>
9. You should have access to the root account of your codespace, so be careful.<br>
